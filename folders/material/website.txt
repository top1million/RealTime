Dear Students,

Below is the site I promissed to send you a while ago and that relates to multi-processing + sockets + multi-threading.

The link is:

http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/


It has useful information regarding C programming in general. In addition, Interprocess communication techniques (pipes, fifos, semaphores, message queues, shared memory, sockets, pthreads, etc) are discussed in details.

Have fun :-)
Hanna.
